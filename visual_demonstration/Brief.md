## Brief

Biome Map at 100 Steps:
Biome map shows the classified environmental zones after 100 simulation steps of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system. The dominant yellow background represents the primary biome type (likely grassland or desert), covering most of the 128x128 grid. In the center, a small but well-defined green patch has emerged, representing a different biome classification based on the underlying chemical concentrations. Within this green region, there are darker gray areas indicating a third biome type, possibly representing areas of higher chemical activity or transition zones. This pattern demonstrates the early stages of biome differentiation, where the reaction-diffusion dynamics have begun to create distinct environmental zones, with the most active chemical reactions concentrated in a compact central region while the surrounding area remains relatively stable.

Agent Distribution at 100 Steps:
It displays the agent positions overlaid on the V chemical field after 100 simulation steps. The black background represents areas with low V chemical concentration, while the gray square in the center corresponds to the region of high chemical activity seen in the biome map. Approximately 100 red dots are scattered across the grid, each representing an individual agent. The agents show a relatively uniform distribution across the environment, with some clustering around the central chemical hotspot but many others exploring the peripheral areas. This distribution pattern suggests the agents are actively foraging and exploring their environment rather than simply congregating in one location. The positioning indicates that while some agents are attracted to the chemically active central region (potentially for resources), others are dispersed throughout the domain, likely following their individual behavioral rules for movement, perception, and energy management within the reaction-diffusion generated landscape.


Changes from 100 to 150 Steps:

Biome Map Evolution (100→150): The central biome structure has undergone significant development over the 50 additional simulation steps. The green region has expanded and become more organized, now displaying a distinct ring-like pattern. Most notably, the gray center has evolved into a purple/magenta core, indicating a new biome classification has emerged due to continued chemical reactions. This progression demonstrates the dynamic nature of the Gray-Scott system, where prolonged chemical diffusion and reaction have created more complex, structured patterns with clearer biome boundaries and a multi-layered ecosystem.

Agent Behavior Changes (100→150): The agent distribution shows subtle but meaningful shifts. While agents remain spread across the environment, there appears to be a slight increase in clustering around the evolved central biome structure, suggesting the agents are responding to the enhanced chemical gradients and more defined environmental zones. The central chemical hotspot has intensified (showing darker contrast), and several agents have positioned themselves near this region, likely attracted by the stronger chemical signals. This behavioral adaptation demonstrates the coupled nature of the simulation, where evolving environmental conditions influence agent movement and distribution patterns over time.
